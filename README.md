# Hash-Discovery
A must-have for pentesters

Discover the clear-text from a hashed password.

Currently, this project only consists of a Python script that creates a text file of all possible character combinations up to fifteen characters. Next, I hope to move the entries to a database and include the hash of every entry. Hashes will include all current popular hashing Algorithms including, but not limited to SHA1 and SHA256. Ultimately, the final product will present a simple GUI that allows the user to input a hashed password or list of hashed passwords and returns the clear-text equivalent.
